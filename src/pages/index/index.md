You need to do something with a domain/website you pay for, correct?

So here's my randomly updated list of bangers that I like:

* **Karan Aujla, Sidhu Moose Wala, Eminem, Barns Courtney, Linkin Park, G-Eazy, Sia**
* **Table for one, seven sticks of dynamite, carry on (The Score) - AWOLNATION.**

I do a lot of reddit, youtube and (apparently) quality shitpost on my Whatsapp groups. I also like Scala (with cats) though.

Btw, the pic on the left is from [Norefjell](https://www.norefjell.com/en), really beautiful place!

There's also one [other website](https://me-ydv-5.github.io/) that I've stopped maintaining. You can find info about some projects that I did there.
